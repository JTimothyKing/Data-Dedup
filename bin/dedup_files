=head1 NAME

dedup_files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

dedup_files --dir /path/to/scan [options...]

=head1 OPTIONS

    --alg, -a      digest algorithm(s) to use (can be specified multiple times)
    --debug        include information only interesting to developers
    --dir, -d      directory under which to scan (can be specified multiple times)
    --help         Print a help summary
    --manpage      Print this manpage for this script
    --outfile, -o  write duplicate report to a named file instead of standard out
    --progress, -P display progress messages on standard error
    --quiet, -q    suppress all messages
    --rcfile       Config file to load
    --verbose, -v  display extra messages
    --version      Print version information and exit
    --write-rcfile Write current options to rcfile

Options that are specified multiple times can also be specified as a
comma-separated list.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program scans one or more directory trees and identifies files that contain
duplicate contents.

The filenames are reported by default on standard out, or written to a file (if
the --outfile option is given). Each distinct file is reported on its own line,
with duplicates listed afterward, separated by tabs.

=head1 ALGORITHMS

The default algorithm sequence used is: filesize initial_xxhash final_xxhash sha.

The following algorithms can be used with the --alg (-a) switch:

=over

=item filesize

filesize - Uses the size of the file as a digest.

=item sample

first-cluster sample - Samples 128 bytes from the first cluster of the file.

=item end_sample

last-cluster sample - Samples 128 bytes from the last cluster of the file.

=item mid_sample

mid-file sample - Samples 128 bytes from the middle of the file.

=item file_head

first bytes of file - Uses the first 1024 bytes of the file as a digest.

=item file_tail

last bytes of file - Uses the last 1024 bytes of the file as a digest.

=item fast_initial_xxhash

first-half-cluster xxHash - xxHash of the first half-cluster of the file.

=item initial_xxhash

first-cluster xxHash - xxHash of the first cluster of the file.

=item final_xxhash

last-cluster xxHash - xxHash of the last cluster of the file.

=item fast_initial_sha

first-half-cluster SHA-1 - SHA-1 of the first half-cluster of the file.

=item initial_sha

first-cluster SHA-1 - SHA-1 of the first cluster of the file.

=item final_sha

last-cluster SHA-1 - SHA-1 of the last cluster of the file.

=item sha

SHA-1 - SHA-1 of the entire file.
